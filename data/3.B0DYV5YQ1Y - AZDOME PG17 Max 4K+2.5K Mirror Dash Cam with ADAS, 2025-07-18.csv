"Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2025","Jeremy","-","yes","Works great!","So this is a pretty awesome device that you can install over your current rearview mirror and it is astonishing. It actually has a full screen rear view from your camera unlike similar models that only have a partial screen. Secondly it has the front camera that can also record all events. So far I have enjoyed all of the time setting it up and it only took me about an hour. It does include some wiring information and you can easily look at it's set up in the Amazon page as well. You may need to buy an extended wiring connection depending on your needs. Other wise this front and back camera recording device is absolutely awesome! I would suggest this purchase for front and rear viewing as long as you are able to set it up correctly. It takes a little trial and error depending on the vehicle that you are using it on. So far do good and worth the price  if there is ever an accident that isn't your fault. I gave this a 4 out of 5 star rating because I think that for the amount charged there should be an included wiring harness to connect the rear camera. Other wise this would be 5 out of 5.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FLL8K8CRMFYZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DYV5YQ1Y","-","-"

Highly recommend","My pictures are not as clear as the one from this dashcam, overall great brightness, super fast connection via wifi, perfect feature to play footage from the same screen, my suggestion to improve would be to cut the long cable for GPS, bulky and useless, all you need is a smaller cable or to attache it to the screen, the other one is the daytime glare because of the screen it's super shine and creates a glare, and I would rethink the rearview camera mounting mechanism with a pressure ball instead of metal brackets with tine screws that can't tighten much, overall very satisfied and surprised, great camera and price doesn't justify.

Without going on a long rant, there are some not so intelligent drivers out there. So, it’s up to us to protect ourselves.  That’s why I ordered this dash Cam.  Not only does it help keep an eye on the “people” in front of me but with the backup camera, it helps me from becoming one of “those people”. The unit boasts voice control and 5g wifi, but it also includes a 64gb card, gps and parking monitoring. I love it because I feel like it adds a layer of protection from potential fraudulent drivers.The voice commands are awesome (and totally cool) -- it impresses those in the car as well.  Like the alerts.Hopefully I don't end up having an accident but in the event that I do and there is a doubt of fault then I feel comfortable having the dashcam.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MJ27HKX3FX9Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DYV5YQ1Y","-","-"
"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2025","Jack ","yes","yes","good","his dash cam has exceeded all my expectations and is one of the best purchases I’ve made for my car. The video quality is excellent—crystal clear during the day and surprisingly sharp even at night. The wide-angle lens captures everything on the road, including the sides, which gives me peace of mind while driving. Installation was quick and easy, and the instructions were very clear. It mounted securely on my windshield and stays in place without any issues.The loop recording and G-sensor features work flawlessly. I’ve already had an instance where someone cut me off and suddenly braked, and the dash cam automatically saved the footage. That video could be crucial for insurance claims. I also love that it starts recording automatically when I start the car, so I don’t have to think about it every time.The build quality feels solid and reliable, and the user interface is simple to navigate. I’ve recommended this dash cam to several friends already, and they’re just as impressed. If you're looking for a dependable, high-quality dash cam at a reasonable price, look no further.

"Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2025","Camille ","-","yes","Tech-Savvy Mirror Cam","This Mirror Cam has some pretty impressive features; the screen is a nice size, provides a clear view, and has good video quality.  This is a solid mirror cam with good video quality and useful features.  The instructional video is helpful, and I recommend watching it for visual details on installing it.  I found the video helpful.  My Husband says he didn't need it, but I saw him peeping and listening as I played it while he installed the wiring down the door panel in his truck (lol).  All of our vehicles are already equipped with lane change assist and GPS features, so these features on the mirror cam may be great for cars without them. Having it on the mirror cam and as part of the vehicle's features is overkill.  I'm also not a fan of having to thread wires. After installing car seat covers in a few of our vehicles this past month, I'm done with threading anything through and around the interior of cars and trucks.  Overall, this is a solid choice for “dash cam” technology.  I am impressed by the level of quality put into making it. The features are high tech and in line with the latest technology today.  I highly recommend this mirror cam.  I was excited to see it in my “Recommended for You” tab.

"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2025","Michelle H","yes","yes","Feature-packed, smart 4K Dashcam","My first impression is this product is thoughtfully designed. It came in a well-packaged box that included everything I needed: the main 4K dashcam, a rear camera, a GPS module, a 64GB microSD card, installation tools, and especially a cigarette socket adapter with a built-in USB port that lets you charge your phone while using the dashcam.The build quality feels premium with high-end materials and a nice finish. The large touch screen is both responsive and bright, making it easy to interact with settings and view footage.Installation was quick and easy as the manual includes a link to a step-by-step video tutorial.The video quality is excellent. The 4K front camera captures sharp, detailed footage that clearly shows surroundings, even in lower lighting. All recordings can be accessed from the mobile app, which is so convenient.My favorite feature is the smart driving assistance system. It includes ADAS, Blind Spot Detection (BSD), and Lane Change Assist (LCA), which provide helpful alerts to enhance road safety. The settings are customizable, allowing you to fine-tune sensitivity, speed thresholds, tones, and even the area of coverage for alerts.Voice control is another standout. Simple commands like “turn on/off recording,” “take picture,” “show front/rear camera,” and “turn off screen” work reliably and add a hands-free convenience for your driving.This is by far the best and first smart dashcam I’ve owned",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hQwLIFE+L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+2lYitrFL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717yZHZxdHL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71853jVrYWL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pVk1tHvOL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xewMdSgVL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81HZ-fZivlL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81qzzrZ7d4L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81uiBQFnawL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7DTSJ3VKJNER/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DYV5YQ1Y","-","-"

Not sure how they look on actual footage but the image on the screen of the device is very very dark for the back camera. When I hold my hand over the top of the back camera, the image brightens up and when I remove it and have the camera just sit normally, it gets very dark with high contrast. Seems to be some kind of HDR or light focusing issue. The reflective surface of the device is just that, a reflective surface, not very mirror like. It’s dark and almost mimics the look and reflectiveness of a phone screen. Both of these issues make it hard to use this as a rearview mirror replacement. I have another AZDOME mirror dash cam, their flagship device and I can dramatically tell the difference in quality. I guess it’s good for the price, but if you can afford to get their highest model, I recommend it.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25VXP384RMJX/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DYV5YQ1Y","-","-"
"Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2025","Sean S.","yes","yes","Great aftermarket mirror and easy to install","I've been using this mirror for a week and I'm quite happy with it.What I like:- The camera/functionality is great right out of the box.- Installation was easy. I purchased the hardwire kit, and the cable was long enough for a 2004 Scion xB. The reverse wire, however, was not, but that's because the Scion's reverse light is in a weird place and not a fault in the kit. I ran an extra few feet of wire to solve that problem.- The hardwire kit comes with multiple fuse jumpers to accommodate whichever type your car uses.- The display image is bright.- I haven't encountered any problems with camera glare, and the HDR seems to perform well at night and when driving directly into/away from the sun.- The installation video provided general information and wasn't too ""vehicle specific.""This mirror is WIDE, and if your cabin is narrow, it may interfere with your driver/passenger visors. Fortunately, the mounting bracket I got allowed me to maneuver the mirror into a position that's just out of the way enough that I'm able to lower both visors without any issue. My Scion is a small car, so if this mirror works for it, it will probably work for most.The few things I'd change:- The default driving impact sensitivity (that determines when the camera saves a recording) is very high. Driving over even moderately bumpy roads triggers the ""save recording"" function. Even after changing it to the least sensitive position, driving over railroad tracks or hitting bumps in the road saves the recording.- The mirror displays messages (like ""Calibration complete"") in a large grey box in the center of the mirror that's a bit distracting when driving since it covers the middle of the rear-view image. I'd prefer something in a corner instead. Fortunately, the messages are only displayed briefly, so they don't block the view for long.I didn't want to have the mirror strapped to my existing mirror, so I purchased a mirror installation bracket/back plate. I couldn't find specs on the bolt pattern for this mirror, so I took a chance. The bracket I picked didn't have the correct bolt pattern, but it only took about 5 minutes to measure, mark, and drill four 1/16"" holes in the bracket.To mount the mirror this way, you'll need to peel back the rubber strips on the back of the mirror mounting plates, which will reveal four, small screws. Remove them and discard the plastic mounting pieces, then use the screws to attach the mirror to the bracket. Voila!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17DT9G6KAZFPP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DYV5YQ1Y","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on May 8, 2025","letmepicyou","-","yes","Great camera, but does NOT come with parking feature.","Overall, I like this dash camera.  The image quality is great, the build quality is great, and it has more features than I care to even mention, but among the basics it has its own GPS antenna, dual cameras, and voice control (!).  It also has a bunch of ""help you drive"" features which I'll likely never use, but they're there if you want them.  It's fairly easy to navigate the UI, and there's also an app to use as well.  I really didn't get into the app, because for me it's easier to plug the SD card into my computer and extract the files I need that way.Installation is...well, FAIRLY easy, but it is a bit tedious to mount the rear camera, depending on where you put it and how your car is set up.  In all, it works really well, and I can't imagine someone not being very happy with this.My only complaint is the fact it doesn't come with the parking feature as stated in the description.  It's a ~$25 add-on feature that you have to purchase separately (B0BM9JL327).  I don't know why this always seems to be an add-on feature; it makes it feel like the micro-transaction video game world has come into real life.  I really don't know who wouldn't want the parking monitor feature, it seems really silly not to have it, and for the life of me I can't imagine why it's not included with the unit itself.Aside from that little omission, the cam itself is great.  Good image, good build, and easy to use.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 13, 2025","David Chen","yes","yes","Ginormous screen and easy install","Ive never attempted to install anything in a car and was a little daunted to try this to be honest cus the friend that referred this dash cam said her Dad did it for her but that he was a mechanic. So when in doubt go to YouTube! And for sure there was a video install of this exact model. My only advice is 100% install the anti-glare film on in your dust free home before you hook it up to the rearview mirror cus OMG the dust specs are everywhere in the car! But overall I think I did a fairly decent job with the install. The first thing I luv about this and that didnt disappoint was how large the screen is.

"Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2025","Customer Review","-","yes","So far so good.","Setting up these style of dash cams is very simple because you pretty much just connect this to your car's charging port, and it should power on every time you run the car. Setup is extremely simple, and the dash cam video quality is solid, although it is not the best by any means, you can still capture everything that you need to capture. It takes a bit of time to get used to the longer rear view mirror, which in my case, was a lot larger than my OEM mirror. The included SD card is horrible, so my suggestion is to pick up a reliable brand such as Sandisk or Samsung.I have been through my fair share of these types of dash cams, and I can assure you that the failing point, if there happens to be one, will 99% of the time be in the capturing of the footage. Over time, these dash cams just start capturing on and off in a super sporadic way, and footage will be all over the place, so I hope this is not the case with this one.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2N4A4XA369PFD/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0DYV5YQ1Y","-","-"

It is impossible to use this at night. The lights from the cars are too bright even when they're far away. I could literally see the car behind me 1 block away stopping at the red light from my side mirror. But when u see it on this dashcam, it is shining soooo bright that the bright white circle from the overexposure is even bigger than the car itself. Most likely no HDR/WDR present.Also the BSD function is so annoying. It marks all the cars with a square box behind me. You can't turn it off under BSD or LCA setting. You must turn on ADAS in order to turn off that annoying car markings. Minus 2 stars for those 2 reasons. Returning this asap.I'll get Wolfbox G850 instead. That one has WDR.

I've tested a couple of these mirror-mounted dashcams from Azdome over the past couple of years, and I've been really impressed with the quality of their products. I believe the PG17 is slightly larger than the last model I tested, with a better rear view camera, a larger screen with a better field of view and a bunch of little extras I've never seen before, like lane departure warnings (though it's possible I just missed that feature on the last model).It's pretty easy to set up the camera. The only challenging part of the installation was running the cable back through the vehicle to the backup camera. I always thought this was a bit of a pain, and I preferred a wireless rear camera, but after testing a few models I've decided that I prefer the zero lag or a wired model. Even a fraction of a second of latency over a wireless connection can get confusing while reversing, but a wired camera has instant transmission.All in all, very impressive.
