I think they made several improvements on their previous model that I used, although some may not be preferred.TLDR; I like it a lot, I would change some things, but they are mostly personal preferences over general user needs.Pros:Camera and microphone quality are great.The initial startup of the camera is a lot more helpful.When you disconnect the camera from the mount, it saves before powering off, so you do not lose the last recorded video.Video clips made are now 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes, and saved to a different folder with a button press or voice command, which makes finding saved moments the intended way easier. With my last camera I would end recordings early to make them easier to distinguish.The buttons are easier to use when driving.It is easier to remove from the mount, since it is just a slide on with no latch mechanism. I wonder if this will hold in an accident, but I am not worried about losing the previous video from it losing power, so it is not a big deal.The phone app is convenient, and I like that the computer app is not needed for convenient video access with computer.Support on Facebook is still very helpful and will do their best to assist you with whatever the issue is.The manual is clearer on some things I asked support about previously, such as if 1 or 5 is the high for the G-Sensor.Cons:In order to get direct file access connecting to the computer, you need to use the USB-C cable that comes with the camera. I just happened to have 3 other cables for other devices, all of which were just black cables, so that was confusing for a bit. I would recommend adding some color to it somewhere to make it more identifiable.Event folder videos will overwrite each other if there is no open recording space. I can see why this is a thing, but also it is risky if you do not move videos off frequently. This is somewhat mitigated by the format reminder, which is new.The camera does not swivel at all. As a plus, you don't have to worry about the angle changing when hitting a button or a bump or another car, but also you cannot change it if something is happening just off camera.It is easy to accidentally set the time wrong when you first set it up without realizing that it uses military time, ie 6PM = 18. It is an embarrassing mistake, but it took me a while to figure out why my dates and times were off.Both:They recommend using one of their SD cards. I used the one I already had with no issues, although I would like if there were an option to add it to the Amazon order, since I didn't realize about theirs until reading the manual.The manual is a bit long, but well written for the most part. The only big change I would make is adding the voice command list in the manual. It references the voice commands, but the list of commands may only be found in the camera menu itself. I figure this may be because the camera may update in the future, and the manual if saved would not update.It includes and adhesive piece for attaching the camera mount, which is good and I did not have it come loose at all. However, wherever you put it is where it will stay indefinitely, so decide well. There are two though, so you get a redo. I would have preferred if the mount were two pieces, so that you may have more than one mount location, but that would also be more expensive.The voice commands are a great addition, since it lets you control the camera with less risk of affecting your driving. Most worked for me and both the camera and remote microphones pick up well, however I could not get a couple voice commands to work ever. Not sure if it is an accent or enunciation thing, but I never got them to work.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71WmcCGgAJL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T9VAHU4A0DLE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

The camera package feels nice. I added an unbox video for the content:- The Vantrue E1 dashcam- A magnetic mount. Very convinient if you want to take the camera with you and connect it to your PC.- A 12V car charger- A USB C cable. It's mainly use for data transfer to your PC.- 2 Electrostatic stickers. Apply the sticker in your widshield and the use fix the camera mount. Don't try to fix the camera mount directly to the widshield.- A wireless remote control. It's has the option to mute/unmute audio, lock the video, and take a picture if you hold the lock video button.Also we may found in the box:- Some warning stickers: Protected by Vantrue- A soft cloth. Convienient at the time before fix the electrostatic sticker in the windshield.- A crowbar to hide the cable.- The user manual. Please, read it first!My experience with the E1 camera.What I liked:- Small size. It doesn't block your field vision and you get less distracted. You can use a voice command 'Turn off screen' to turn the screen off and reduce any kind of distraction.- Wifi connection with the Vantrue App. It's the best option to look at the videos and play them using your mobile. It's easy to use and the app do not ask to create an account to use this feature.- Night videos are amazing. This is one of the strong features.- The remote control. You can stick it in your steerwheel and have the most common function you may need when you are driving: mute the camera, lock the video or take a picture.- Voice control feature. Do not requiere a voice activation command, only say ""take photo"" and it will perform the operation. The commands I have tested with are:""Lock video"", ""take photo"", "" turn off screen"", "" mute camera""The voice command are available also if you have muted the camera.What I think Vantru should do better:- Give a list of the possible voice command. It has been a discovering process found the commands.Who you should get this camera?If you are in a marked looking a camera with a high resolution: (2592 x 1944P 30 FPS), a wide angle of 160 degrees, a nice quality night videos f1.8 plus the extra of having a voice control, a remote control and wifi app, Vantrue E1 offers a good product.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1AHV3LLHNOE2P/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

I had it hooked up to a high capacity battery in my car to run continuously for up to 4 days, and my car mostly sat in the garage during this time, where the temperature didn’t go above 90° F, except for daily trips to do errands (outdoor temperature between 88 and 97° F).Picture quality was outstanding using the 1440p setting, and it detected events based on motion detection (vs. impact., although it has both).Unfortunately, after the first week, I noticed the recording light start to blink off occasionally, and checking the recordings confirmed that it was skipping multiple minutes, or sometimes an entire trip, essentially rendering it useless.Additionally, I could not get it to connect to the app even once, spending over an hour trying different settings, airplane mode with wi-fi enabled, etc. But the deal-breaker was that it stopped reliably recording.",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ICLQ5FD0JMON/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

"Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2022","KC","yes","yes","The Best Mini-Dash Cam you can buy? I think so.","I purchased the Vantrue E1 almost a month ago and was unsure of what I was getting into because when it arrived, it is very small. I was surprised at how solid the box felt and as such, the dash cam was also a solid feeling device, not plasticky or of poor quality like the previous dash cam I was using.Installation of the E1 is a snap with the included cables but I highly recommend the Vantrue Hardwire kit which allows you to easily and quickly hide your wires and run power to the fusebox. It's cheap and a much better way to install your dash cam.Video on the E1 seems to go on forever with the 64GB card I purchased. I don't know how many hours fit on one card but it has lasted me weeks with my relatively short drives to work. They must use excellent compression on the video to make it last so long. The video also looks excellent as you can see in the many other videos people have provided. The included GPS sensor is a big plus for me and although I'm not sure how necessary it is now, that is the reason I upgraded to the E1 from my old system.Living in the city, I am often worried about someone breaking into the car and taking the dash cam but I feel like the E1's small size makes it hard to notice and less likely to get stolen. When I am really worried about it, I simply pull it down because it attaches with a really slick magnetic slide system that allows you to simply pop it off and put it in the your center console in seconds.In the end, I highly recommend the Vantrue E1 because it is so small so I feel like it is unlikely to get noticed and stolen if I leave it attached, the picture quality is outstanding and it was so easy to install. I am very happy with my upgrade. Great job Vantrue!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R6NP9M43XZ4XI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

Voice Control, Motion Sensor and Video quality is OUTSTANDING!","Bought this camera after having a close call a few days ago.  Wanted to have video evidence if anything ever happened to me and/or my family.  It comes with a power outlet power adaptor and a windshield mount (double sided tape).  I bought a 512GB SD card and opted for the Hardwire Kit which was a BIG surprise in itself with all of the options to plug into a fuse box.  Setting up the camera was VERY simple.  Just a few clicks and it was up and running.  The green light facing the driver that shows it's being powered and/or recording is very easy on the eyes.  Drove a little and came back to view the video on my phone.  Connecting to the camera via WiFi was easy and downloading a video was a snap.  I also saved the video to my iPhone Photos app.  I then tried all of the voice control features and they worked perfectly, I would imagine the most used would be the ""Take Photo"" feature.  I had the camera's Parking Mode turned on using the Motion Sensor.  It works perfectly.  The video I uploaded shows my USPS carrier coming up and the video is crystal clear.  I also uploaded a screen capture so you can see the clarity.  Viewing the videos on a PC is something to behold.  ALL details are easily seen.  Viewing a video while driving shows car tags very clearly.  The GPS feature (which can also be stamped onto the videos) is also a HUGE plus to show where you have been.Vantrue, you've made a customer out of me.  I give this a 5 out of 5 star rating.

Whether its wildlife, other drivers or just bad weather, these are helpful if any accident occurs. With that being said, I've used a fair amount of models. We currently run a Vantrue m2 in our van and I love how sleek it fits. I've had a dash cam in the wife's car for several years now, but she hates having a camera in her viewing area. Shes just not a fan of 'techy' stuff in her life. The M2 was a great option, but she wanted the actual mirror and not the screen.In comes the E1.... it now hides behind her rear view mirror and doesn't obstruct at all. The cables are routed so they aren't noticeable... and its now an afterthought for her. I will say, the small size does compromise the buttons/navigation.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022","JettaRed","yes","yes","Amazing little camera!  UPDATE","UPDATE:  This is my second Vantrue E1 camera and I still think it is great (obviously).  I am adding it to my second car because traffic has gotten crazy and drivers have gotten so aggressive, I wanted the comfort of knowing that the traffic around me is being recorded.  There are a bunch of YouTube videos by traffic lawyers strongly recommending having a dashcam and the Vantrue E1 fits the bill perfectly.  All of my original comments below still hold.First, I had the Garmin Mini 2.  Nice camera, but just none of the features other than basic date and time markers plus audio.  The Vantrue E1, however, is full featured with date, time, audio, speed, location, etc.  The GPS sensor is built into the mount.  Size wise, the Vantrue E1 is about as high as the Garmin, but almost twice as wide.  But, when mounted, the Vantrue seems ""smaller"" than it is.  For all the added features of the E1, it was well worth the lesser price!  (The E1 was actually $10 less than the Garmin Mini 2.) I do recommend getting the polarizing lens filter, though the reflection is nowhere as bad as with the Garmin.  And the hardwire kit makes the installation look professional, as well as enabling the Parking function.  All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21HQ2Y4NX2ZQU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2022","John Z. Liang","yes","-","Perfectly Fine Little Car Camera","This is a very interesting camera.  There seems to be a good side and a bad side to all of its designs.  How you feel about this camera depends on what you value.First of all, the mounting system is unique.  Instead of using a suction cup system the mount consists of two parts.  First a plastic sheet clings to the windshield via static and then the mount tapes to the sheet with 3M tape.  I guess the idea here is that since the 3M tape is not a reusable thing if you want to move the camera you take off the plastic sheet, there is a removal tool that came in the box, and move it that way.  In reality I am not sure how it will work out.The power cable is USB-C with a 90deg bend.  This is great since you can connect it with the 90deg up or down and provides great strain relief.The mount itself only swivels forward or backwards, allowing you to level the camera's field of view.  It doesn't have the left/right rotation that allows to adjust the pan of the camera.  If you happen to tape the mount up a bit crooked and the camera favors the one side over the other there is no adjustment short of pulling the mount off and reattach.The camera to mount attachment is very simple.  Slide it in and that is pretty much it.  The problem is that there is no mechanism to keep the camera in there except for friction between the camera and the  mound.  You can pull the camera out easily with one hand which is a good thing, for now.  I have a bit of concern regarding how this is going to work out long term.  With the way my windshield slopes, the mount is actually tilted upward.  So the camera to mount connection is actually sloped upward.  With only friction preventing the camera rom sliding down and out of the mount I am not sure if the daily removal/reinstall ion of the camera will wear this out to a point where it wouldn't be able to stay on the mount any more.Now to the camera itself.  It is very compact and doesn't get into the field of view much.  The picture quality is pretty good and the sound recording is clear.  However, because it is small, some sacrifices are needed.A small but annoying issue is that there is only a down button for the menu navigation.  So if you accidentally went pass the line you want, the only way to get back to it is to cycle through the entire menu.  Another issue is that the screen is fairly small and it is square shape.  The camera's natural aspect ration is 16:9 so you can either see the entire16:9 in a smaller view on the square screen or see it in full screen mode which loses the edge of the view.  Another annoying thing is that the camera only acts as  USB drive when connected to the computer.  You can't power it via the computer and adjust the setting like other cameras from this company.  However, all these small annoyances are alleviated by one new feature, WIFI.  You can connect the camera via wifi to your phone.  It is much easier to adjust settings in the app and adjust the viewing field of the camera with the live view feature of the app.  Another thing that WIFI allows you to do is to see the video recorded on the camera in the phone app and down it.  You do have to stop the camera from recording and then turn the wifi on before you can connect to to it.  Fumbling with the buttons on the small camera can be challenging which is why there is another new feature, voice assistant.  You can turn the screen on/off, start/stop recording, turn on/off wifi by just speaking to the camera.  This is pretty cool but does require a quiet background.  i don't think I ever got it to work with the radio on.A more serious problem is that the camera gets hot.  Heat is the worst enemy for the longevity of electronics and this camera gets hot even just by itself.  Now add in the scorching sun and this is a bit of concern for me.  It is not scolding hot but you couldn't comfortably hold it in you hand either.Overall this is a pretty cool camera with some new tricks up its sleeve.  If you just need a good camera to stay in one vehicle you can't go wrong with this one.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JIossJFqL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQQ8E9YJ0ISKF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2022","MN","yes","-","Nice Upgrade to the T2","I’ve been looking to upgrade from the T2 version I bought a few years back for a few reasons. 1) No WiFi connection - It was a great camera but in order to pull any videos off of it I had to remove the camera and plug it into a computer, or pull out the SD card. The connector on the T2 is a little different and more of a hassle to remove than this E1, especially with where I place the camera in my car. Behind my rear view mirror on the right side so as not to distract me while driving. 2) The camera was held on the windshield by a suction cup, which is great if you’re concerned about leaving marks on your window but whenever it was hot and I parked in the sun, I would return to my car with the camera either hanging by the cord, or more often than not, disconnected from the cord in my cup holder. The suction cup did not hold up at all.Now with this E1, I can connect via WiFi which is much less of a hassle than physically having to remove the camera. The E1 is connected via a magnet as well, so even if I needed to remove the camera to adjust settings or connect to a PC, it’s much less work than the older T2. The camera is also installed via 3M double sided tape as well, so no more camera falling off of the windshield anymore either. The camera is also about 60% more compact, so while I’m driving I don’t even see it there. It’s nice to know it is there but not having it obstructing my view while driving.This is a huge upgrade for me and my T2 will now be going into our second car. Over time, if I see that the E1 lives up to my current expectations I might just end up upgrading for our 2nd car as well.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61U2EO+xw2L.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RN9GP42OERX9S/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

Also being in Florida with the heat the supercapacitor works brilliantly without failing due to the weather.

"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2023","Ruben","-","-","Best DashCam!? What…🤯","As the title states, I believe I have finally located a company with the best Dashboard/Vehicle Cameras on the market! Bold claim I know, but let me just put it to you this way, if Vantrue says it’s going to work, it does, PERIOD!Before this Vantrue E1 camera, I purchased the Vantrue Element 2 camera system, I did this only after researching for 3 months, because I am that guy, LOL 😁! Needles to say, I absolutely made the correct choice in choosing Vantrue Cameras. So when I seen the opportunity to get the smaller E1 and install it in my other truck, I jumped at the chance, and as you know I got this one for free, so saved some good money😉!The install is easy, I HIGHLY recommend buying the OBD connection to supply constant power to you camera, this will allow you to take full advantage of all the features. The box comes with everything you need to get started for normal use, meaning the camera is running only while the car is on (you will either need to buy the hardwire kit or the OBD connector i mentioned). You get extra double sided gel tape, which is an awesome touch by Vantrue, as this does not leave any residue on your surfaces when removed. Vantrue gives you a SUPER generous length of cabling, I literally had to stuff the rest of it behind the panel molding of the door jam, its a lot, which is AWESOME!I’m going to wrap it up with this, you have many resolutions to pick from, I picked the best ones, and the picture quality is amazing day/night when you download the video/picture. I love that the video is also tied to google maps, so in the app as you watch the video, you see exactly where the vehicle is traveling on the map as the video plays. There are so many great features here at an amazing price point, these cameras with Garmin, Cobra will cost you $70-200 more.I would like to say these last 2 important things, I purchased a regular memory card, Samsung brand which works great, Vantrue states you need their self branded items. Lastly the app needs a little work, it’s not bad, just a little clunky, but you are able to set-up your camera settings and download videos by connecting your phone/device to the camera WiFi, which is cool. You will love this camera, I already did all the research for you.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611vYdZIdAL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QlMs4Y5ML.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VLvFMX4HL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61X9cY3oEWL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r8CmGPprL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ysohfWGDL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3AQ68OTNH8CQL/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2023","Gary","-","-","Close to Excellent, Almost easy to use","For the price, I don't think you can beat the Vantrue E1. It's small and unobtrusive when installed on the windshield. The video quality is superlative, even when using the lower resolution 1080p 60fps option. The optional polarizing filter ($20) is well worth the price. Without it, glare can be very problematic, especially if you're driving into the sun. Be sure to use a micro-SD card designed for dashcam use, giving the card the ability to withstand continuous writing/erasing/rewriting. The E1 supports up to a 512gb card, but a 128gb card should meet most people's needs. The unit can be set to record either 1-, 3-, or 5-minute clips. On a longer drive, the unit will record a continuous series of clips until the card is full, at which point it will start writing over the oldest clips with new ones. A typical 3-minute clip at high resolution takes about 350mb, so you would get 5+ hours of recording before the unit would start writing over the oldest files. I did some experimenting with resolution options. I can report that the 1080p 60fps option does produce the smoothest video (especially at highway speeds) but the resolution is not adequate for discerning license plate numbers. In a road mishap, you definitely want to be able to read license plate numbers. The 1444p 30fps option allows HDR. HDR (high dynamic range) does produce the most vibrant colors, but the resolution while good, is not quite good enough to read license plates. Note that HDR should not be used at night (it greatly increases video noise). The Vantrue programming does allow for HDR to be automatically turned off between hours you select. The 1990p 30fps option, also called full 2k, is the clear winner when it comes to being able to read license plates and road signs. Unfortunately, this setting doesn't allow HDR to be enabled. But this is the optimum setting in the event of an accident when you need the highest resolution videos for insurance or legal reasons. I found the smartphone app works well and allows me to change menu options much easier than trying to change settings on the very small screen on the EI head unit. The ability to transfer videos and still shots to one's phone, tablet, or computer is best facilitated by pulling the SD card from the EI and putting the card into whatever reader adapter device you have for your electronic devices. One irritating aspect of this, though,  is that everytime you remove the SD card, it must be reformatted when you reinsert the card. And while the E1 does have voice control (such as ""Lock the Video""), the one command missing is ""reformat SD card"". Maybe with a firmware update Vantrue could add this functionality. I think if you have a bigger budget, buying a real 4K dashcam might be worth it, but be sure it it REAL 4k, and not a lesser device with manipulated specs.  However, on a budget, the E1 does everything you need it to, and is relatively easy to use. And for whatever this is worth, it does look and feel like a high quality unit. Finally, the included remote control button which allows you to turn the audio on/off, or to snap a still shot is very handy and a great bonus.",4,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19364J0X051JF/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BGGGG4VW","B0B2W81VG6","Color: Dark Gray"

The video ended up coming out great even though there was nothing smooth about the ride. The power adapter cord was the only weird thing. If I plugged anything into the USB charge port the camera would lose its power. Kinda seemed a little odd. At any rate, I ended up powering the camera with a battery bank since the truck's power ports shut off when the ignition was off.

The dash cam comes on when the vehicle starts and shuts off when I turn off the vehicle on it own, no other button do I have to push (which is great).  I put a 16 GB micro-SD card it in, so you can either use the app on your phone or plug it in your computer or use a SD card reader to see your recording.  Evidently if you are in an accident the device will save the last few minutes into another folder on the SD card so you can retrieve it to use for insurance purposes or who was at fault.  The device has a good pan of the road in front of you and would catch any vehicle on either side right by your front fender if you have it mounted correctly on your windshield.  It is removeable by magnetic means, so you can take it with you or just leave it in the vehicle, the base will stay on the windshield hooked up to the power which makes it very convenient.

Aspects like quality, fit and finish, user operation are all top notch. I was set up and ready to record within a few minutes. Set up was breeze since everything you need to get started is in the box. They also provide you with two adhesive pads in case you need to reposition the camera or move it to another car. The adhesive also looks to be made by 3M, so it should last a long time with no worries about coming undone in the summer months.The companion app that can be used to pull or review footage from the camera also works without any issues. I was able to connect the app to the camera within a couple of minutes. I wish it would stay connected when the camera is recording, but that’s only a minor change I’d like to see added.Aside from the instruction manual (which is easy to read) the factory screen protector has a quick cheat sheet printed on it so you can easily figure out what buttons to press within the navigation menu. Although it’s designed to be peeled off after installing the camera (its opaque), I decided to keep it in the car for quick reference if I ever forget what each button does.The only thing I don’t like about the setup is the mount that holds the camera to the windshield.
