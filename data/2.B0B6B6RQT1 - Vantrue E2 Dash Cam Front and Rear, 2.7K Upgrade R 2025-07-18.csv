"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2022","IT Guy","yes","yes","Not ready for prime-time - updated review","08/26/22 update - after some fairly annoying back & forth with Vantrue support, it's confirmed that when power to the camera is cut off (e.g. you've turned off your car), the camera shuts down completely.  So, unless you hardwire it to CONTINUOUS 12v power, the camera will shut down when you turn off the car, and you will have no video coverage should someone bang into your car.  The supercapacitor mentioned in the product description does absolutely nothing to provide power in the event of something like a bump to the car or motion in its field of view regardless of which parking mode you have selected.08/23/22 - Purchased on 08/18/22 to replace an existing dashcam in my wife's car.  Spent the last few days doing some prep and waiting for some parts (e.g. split loom to protect the cable to the rear camera, 256GB mSD card, etc.) before I begin the install process.  In the meantime, I took the opportunity to update its firmware & bench test the camera before moving ahead, and discovered a few issues (at least with the unit that I received) and those of you that have purchased it may want to check your units to see if you have the same issuesTo save a lot of summarizing, I've pasted the message that I sent to Vantrue (please excuse the typos, I had to retype it several times because of site timeouts), via the form on their website, below.  I will update this in response how it's handled.--- start of message to support ---Hi,I purchased an E2 dash cam through your Amazon store and have encountered an issue with it.The E2:- is updated to the H042 firmware version,- was reset to factory defaults after the update, and- has a SanDisk 128GB high-endurance microSD that was reformatted by the E2 after the update/Currently, the E2 has the following settings configured:- Auto LCD Off - set to [Off]- Parking Mode - set to [Collision Detection] with all sensitivities set to [5]- Low-light Night Vision in Parking Mode - set to [On]Symptoms:#1 - When a continuous USB-C power source (using the Vantrue-supplied USB-A-to-USB-C cable) to the power input of its windshield mount, the camera will:- display the message [The dashcam is about to shut down and enter collision detection mode] after ~5 minutes, then- go idle - but it moving or tapping the camera will wake it up and trigger its collision mode.#2 - Disconnecting the E2 from the power supply:- causes it to shut down completely, and- it does not wake when moved or firmly tapped with a finger or pen (to simulate a collision when disconnted from continuous power.)Problems/questions:#1 - why is the camera going into its [collision mode] even when connected to continuous power, and how do I stop this behavior?#2 - why is the camera powering down and unresponsive after continuous power is disconnected?  What purpose does its super-capacitor serve, if not to enable the [collision detection] recording when the vehicle is parked & off?Is this unit defective and, if so, how do I get this rectified?",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTPOGE601RES5/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"
"Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2022","bsf","yes","yes","My long, tortuous and sad journey with vantrue","Update 9/17/2002: After weeks of tests, everything points that the problem is the hardwire kit being extremely picky with my 2002 accord hybrid. I will be testing the new hardwire kit and updating the review with the new results. Upgraded the rating from 1 to 3 stars pending the results of the new tests. Kudos to the company for sticking with me and try to find a solution.Update 8/31/2022: Vantrue has been very proactive, trying to fix the problem. They sent an evaluation unit, and I've been interacting with them to try to pinpoint the problem. I need to give them credit for not abandon me, and continuing support. It is rare when a company tries really hard to improve their products. I will update again once the problem its identified.Original post: Lets first start with the TL/DR version:-If you live in a hot area (Texas, Arizona... you get the idea), hardwire this camera (using the OEM venture hardwire accessory) and turn on the low bitrate recording for parking mode... it will FAIL because the camera overheats under the sun, then shutdowns, forcing you to manually turn back the camera on.Now, the long version:My journey started like anybody else... 'hey, I bought a new car, since I love my new car, I'll buy a camera to protect my investment and my hard-earned money'. Then I saw the vantrue cameras, and they had a good deal, because Prime day, there was a nice offer. For $178, the Vantrue X4S duo seemed a good buy. Another $25 for the GPS mount, plus $25 for the hardwire kit, plus an obscene $55 for a vantrue sd (sandisk cost around $35 for the same endurance card). Installed everything, then my nightmare started. Every morning I drove to work, parked on the parking lot, when I returned the camera was kaput. Turned back the camera on, hoping the next day it was fixed. Nothing. I contacted support. Because they are based in China, they respond your emails usually the next day. After 20+ emails and several firmware versions/patches installed in the camera, the same outcome. I decided to return everything.Now, because I'm masochist, I decided to give it an opportunity to the E2 (element 2) camera. basically the same price of the X4S duo, but the main camera plus the rear one are 2K resolution (compared with the 4k front + 1k back on the X4s). As soon as I turned on the camera, a message comes to the screen ""FOR HIGH TEMPERATURE PLACES, ITS RECOMMENDED THE COLLISION DETECT FOR THE PARKING MODE"". So they know their cameras shuts down when the heat ramps up, but they wont automatically resume when temperatures drop down. UPDATE: sure enough, today was 101 F over Houston, the camera shuts down. When the temperature dropped, the camera stayed off. Required manually to be turned back on.There is some little improvements over the X4s-now GPS mount is included-the mount is magnetic, easier to remove the camera-the firmware is less confusing than the one in the X4s, with big icons-a little heavier than the X4s, feels a little more solidSo, buy this camera if:-you wont use the hardwire kit to keep the camera constantly recording when you turn off your car-you park your car on a covered garage, or you live underground in a cave (think Batman) or on the north/south pole. Siberia could work.-you are Ubering, and the temperature inside the cabin its not high because your poor car is working day and night moving people from one place to another.If you live in an area where a typical day is over 100F, look somewhere else. You are warned.",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39VNJPGXB6C7E/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"
"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2022","RedShiftRider","yes","yes","This Thing Feels 6 Years Old","There’s plenty of dashcam options out there for less than half the price that blow this thing out of the water.My previous dashcam (Kingslim D4 dual cam) that I bought 3 years ago finally failed.I settled on this camera as a replacement. It was the only camera with app functionality, dual cameras, and seemed like a decent design.I decided to return the camera 2 minutes after opening it. I can’t believe how old and outdated this thing feels. The screen is tiny, and it’s not a touch screen. The 4 hard buttons on the bottom of the camera used to navigate the menus are extremely hard to find. And very frustrating to use. Changing settings in the menus is unnecessarily difficult and clumsy.My previous camera had touch screen capability and was much easier to use. And much more user friendly. All around easier, better in basically every way. Not to mention that this camera is twice the price for no reason at all. Again, the Kinglism was purchased over 3 years ago, and this camera feels much older than that one. Although the seller says it was just released in Aug. 2022.This camera was $250 minus a $50 coupon. My old Kingslim was $100 for exactly the same features - dual cameras, app connectivity - and a bigger, more user friendly touch screen. There’s absolutely no reason this camera should be priced at over $200. It possesses no features that justify that price.On top of that, when I tried to download the app, it has a 1 star rating with everyone complaining the camera will not connect to the app after a recent update.I’ve attached a photo of this camera next to my old 3 year old camera for size reference.I’ve returned this and gone with a different option.",2,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71LbW4V2flL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34HEW6CGA8FLT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

I notice at about a year and a half I started getting an error message stating I had an error in the as card so I would have to restart it and it would be fine. Now I have a very good and card but last week I got into my car with the dash cam front screen broken and a piece of it in my center console. Now these cameras are designed to be in a car for extended periods so I was not worried about heat messing with it. But I was wrong the unit had swelled so bad that it cracked the front screen and warped the entire camera. I really liked the camera when it was working but now I’m afraid to purchase another in fear that my car may catch fire due to the unit exploding. I’m not sure if this unit has a battery inside cause I purchased the hardwired kit to keep it running all the time for parking mode. All in all I don’t think I could trust this brand again unless I have a faulty unit.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022","Matt","yes","yes","Great Wifi Dashcam for the price","Installation and first impression- Everything needed to mount this camera is included in the box, making it easy to install.- Packaging was very friendly and sturdy, ensuring the contents would not be damaged during shipping.- The design is very sleek. The front camera reminds me of a compact GoPro, while the back camera reminds me of a desktop webcam.- The cigarette-mounted power supply has a USB port, so you don't lose a spot to charge other devices like your phone.- Electrostatic sticker is a great option for installion, I always hated 3m tape directly to the window, with this setup, no more residue if I want to remove it in the future.Features- Comes with a wireless hotkey button that you can mount anywhere. This button allows you to initiate voice commands and start an emergency video capture and snap photos. I chose to mount my next to the ignition for easy access. This is much better than fumbling to press the small emergency event button on the dashcam. Voice commands are a great addition since it lets you control the camera with less risk of affecting your driving. Most worked for me, and the microphones picked up my voice well.- 2k recording on both front and rear cameras, a sample image of both in the attached review. Remarkable in both night and day recordings. Decent for license plate recognition.- 5GHz Wi-Fi connectivity is faster and more reliable than 2.4 GHz, but it includes both for easy connection from phone to dashcam. The 5GHz connection allows for faster transfers of video clips from the dashcam to my phone.- Nice large LCD color screen, which is helpful for settings the camera and reviewing the footage if needed.- The dashcam is removable, which is great for high-risk areas like the SF bay area.- Comes with a GPS module that can record your speed and display it on the recordings, which can be helpful when getting a speeding ticket to prove innocence- UI is very intuitive and user-friendly; everything is laid out very well for easy navigation.OverviewThis camera has many features that can go head to head with many higher-priced market units. The little cameras can be attached to your front and rear window in minutes and can save you a boatload of money with video evidence in the event of an accident; having both front and back helps document the entire accident. I can highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for one.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xfuJq-RoL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BRIxVFmbL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KlLSFQXJL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NoEuRLD+L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71R4lmmjlFL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oKdJ5OeQL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8161CN5Fu4L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81FWGt5zD7L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81z0UC9NvnL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM33O6O3ECC3K/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

First one worked great for years, this one not so much. First couple months everything worked fine then one day realized rear camera wasnt turning on. Soon after the front camera would only turn on in motion monitoring mode and stopped recording all together.I troubleshooted everything connection wise since it was hardwired into the fuse box. Plugging it in to the dash12v outlet, checked it with a multimeter. Nothing fixed it. Here's where it gets interesting.Contacted vantrues customer service for a warranty replacement. Over series of emails back and forth with basic suggestions on troubleshooting no progress was being made. They eventually told me that it was not eligible for warranty replacement since I had purchased it through a third party vendor- Amazon. Vantrue is listed as the seller on my invoice which so kindly circled for me. They also obviously have a store page on Amazon with easy to find links detailing their warranty policies....on Amazon!I eventually got this refunded through Amazon customer service even through it was beyond the return window- thank you! But I'm done buying from vantrue. You have been warned, this company will be quick to answer your emails but will do everything they can to avoid honoring their warranty policy since apparently any Vantrue product purchased on Amazon is ineligible for their warranty.

I wish Vantrue offered both types of mounting options so the user can chose whichever works best for their application.  I'm not sure how the sticker method will hold up with the heat wave the Bay Area is currently experiencing.  The rear camera was a bit tricky to install because the wires was somewhat difficult to snake into the headliner and tailgate of my vehicle.I upgraded from a Vantrue S1 cam and the image reproduction is significantly a night and day difference.  It should be since the S1 is only a 1080P vs E2 1440P.  One of selling points of the E2 is the built in wifi so you can easily download the files by using the Vantrue App (3 minute video loop files takes a while to Dl because of the file size).  So you can show the officer after the event what really happened instead of having to DL the video with a PC.  A feature I like is the voice control - user can command the unit to take a pic, turn on/off wifi, turn off screen.  Another feature I want to mention is the handy remote if you do not want to use the voice control feature - to just take random pics of cool cars, people crossing the street, planes overhead, etc.Overall the Vantrue E2 is an amazing dash cam for the price and will surprise you with the numerous options it offers!  Amazing videos/picture reproduction during day time and pretty good in low light (manufacturers have not mastered the night yet).The only gripes I have:1. The plug for the rear cam should be on the side instead of the top2. Offer 2 type of mounting options the electrostatic tape method and suction cups (so I can use the suction cups whenever I rent a car.3.  The Circular Polarizing Lens should have been included (i have major reflections/glare from my leather dash)4. Vantrue should manufacture flat wires so hiding wires should be a breeze5. Offer cloud storage and live view similar to Thinkware and BlackVue6. The car charger should have been a plug and dual port USB version. So I can connect the power cable to a ext battery pack like Rav Power for extended parking mode.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZQpjPoX6L.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11BR0CSWQZ09U/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2022","Luan N.","yes","yes","Initial Review","Packaging:The Vantrue E2 dash cam comes in a nice little box with everything you should need for installing the cam as a plug and play. For hardwiring you will need to purchase the hardwire kit from Vantrue, and maybe a longer car trim/panel puller depending on your vehicle.Installation & Set Up:Installation of the dash cam with the hardwire kit took me about 2.5 hours to route and hide all of the wiring, installing both front & rear cam. Setting up the dash to the app should be simple, just read through the provided guide. Recording settings is complete done out of the box so you likely won't be messing to much with it.Quality:After taking it out for a short drive, I rewatched the video and the quality is nice and crisp as expected.The dash cam and mount feels very stable and solid. The mounting style of this camera is using an electrostatic sticker and 3M tape, so I will have to see how well it holds up to the AZ heat.The parking mode has several options, the one that was recommended for hot climate was ""Collision Detection"", they also have the ""Motion Detection"" as well which I'm guessing could cause the camera to overheat if there is a significant amount of traffic (I'll have to test this option little more).",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614EsRuaNJL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61DCXsIfVFL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61E0NItVMhL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dnRvZ6xHL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q-XhWkTWL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HArSbiJuL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nuCsULThL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IU04U3SS4URV/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

I had it professionally installed with the Vantrue cable kit.  And the bottom line is this camera is unreliable. It arbitrarily just stops recording.  I find myself constantly checking to ensure the green light is flashing (indicator that it is actively recording), so at this point it has become a distraction.  NOT GOOD.  I have swapped out the unit, I have reformatted and swapped out the memory card, I have updated the firmware.  Vantrue's recommendation was to use the cigarette adapter power cord to see if that resolves the issue.  The unit isn't losing power.  It just isn't reliable and doesn't work properly.When it DOES record, the picture is great.This is my first dash cam so I am finding the wifi connection to be very wonky...truly everything about this unit feels wonky.I do NOT recommend it, and only gave it 2 stars because when it is recording I can't fault the actual recording.  They look good.  But the unreliability is a complete deal breaker here.  I've glanced at it SO MANY TIMES to realize it's not recording...and grateful that something didn't happen in that moment.

My cameras so far haven't fallen off, but my nephew's cams were falling off.

I say emails because I didn't realize that the first 2 replies they sent were getting routed to the spam folder...totally my fault for overlooking it. The 3rd email I was able to catch and they sent the replacement stickers once I gave them my address.On a separate note I've been very happy with my dashcams so far and the clarity is better than I thought it would be. I'm not too sure how much of a difference there is between 2.7K and 4K video displays, but the 2.7K on my dash cams serves it's purpose. The only issue I have had was the video display on my phone would freeze up once in a while and I have to close the Vantrue app and tap it back to get the video to come on live again. As a first time user of dash cam I wanted to see what the cameras were seeing, but now that I've had the cams for a while I don't even connect my phone anymore except to go into the settings to turn the interior camera off on the E3 model.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2022","Texan","yes","-","Excellent dual camera dash cam system","I own two other Vantrue dash cams and have been very happy with them. I wanted a new camera that supported WiFi 5 and came with both front and rear cameras. Voice control was also a requirement since the dash cam is usually hidden behind the rear view mirror and not reachable by the driver.I am impressed by the video quality from both cameras. Two separate video files are created so you can look at them independently. The cameras were easy to install using the included electrostatic stickers from 3M. Spare stickers are included in case you need to move the cameras in the future. With the new design mount of this camera, the camera is easy to remove. The voice control works well. You can tell the camera to take a photo and enable or disable the microphone. Also with the customizable shock sensor sensitivity, the camera will automatically take photos and isolate videos before/after an incident. I highly recommend Vantrue dash cams based on my previous experience with the brand.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71pLk2IcDLL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71prcG9T8ZL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81Fsl7kiGUL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3EA6B4Y2BZL1T/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

I am very happy with the value of the E2. It was super easy to install and get setup. It comes with a great manual and plenty of supplies to get setup. The cables it came with were long enough to allow routing to hide the cable. I like the wifi feature which let's me pull data off the camera to my phone without having to get the card out of the camera. I have not had any issues with the mounts even in my high horsepower car and with my heavy foot. There was a firmware update that was available on the website and the update process was super easy.

"Reviewed in the United States on February 27, 2023","Nils","-","-","Easy and simple to install","Let's start with dashcams in general. Dashcams can offer several benefits to drivers. For example, they can serve as evidence in the event of accidents or unexpected incidents to clarify the causes of the incident. They can also help locate stolen vehicles by possibly containing images of people or vehicles seen near the scene of the crime.Additionally, dashcams can contribute to improving road safety by reminding drivers to observe safety rules such as obeying speed limits or avoiding distractions such as using phones while driving. In summary, dashcams can help improve road safety and serve as a valuable tool in analyzing traffic accidents or thefts.Let's move on to the hardcore technical details. Both cameras have a resolution of 2.5K and are Wi-Fi compatible, offering GPS tracking. There is also a smart voice control. Both cameras have a field of view of 160°. The package that I was kindly provided with includes:  2.5K Front Dash Cam  2.5K Rear Camera  Wireless Remote Controller  Rear Camera Cable (20FT)  Magnetic GPS Mount  4.8A Fast Car Charger  USB Cable (3.3FT, for transferring files only)  Electrostatic Stickers  Warning Stickers; Crowbar;  User ManualThere is also additional hardware that is available separately. A polarizing filter, which filters the reflection of the front and rear windshield, or a hardwire kit, which enables a 24-hour parking mode. This is then linked to motion detection and saves a video clip of a total of 35 seconds in the event of motion. 5 seconds before and 30 seconds after the motion.First step - Firmware updateFirst, we insert an SD card into the front camera housing. The rear camera also records on the same memory card via USB-C connection, so it must also be a correspondingly fast SD card. The storage size is secondary, as only a maximum loop of 5 minutes is possible.After formatting the SD card from the dashcam, we can establish a direct connection to the laptop or PC with the supplied USB-C cable and copy the firmware to the SD card.Second step - Installation in the carI need to provide a little background information. We currently have a 2006 Toyota Sienna. Many components are already outdated, loose, and a little worn out. With the help of the included plastic pry bar, for example, the cable for the rear camera could be laid pretty easily. So well, in fact, that it is completely hidden.For the front camera, I was forced to not mount it on the windshield according to DC regulations of the DMV. Now it sticks to the dashboard and holds surprisingly well. The power supply is regulated via the car charger, and fortunately, you don't lose a possible USB charging port thanks to the built-in USB ports.As soon as the power is turned on via the car's ignition, both cameras turn on and start recording immediately. With a push of the left of the four buttons, you can stop a recording and check the settings first. I had to flip the image because the camera is basically upside down - it went smoothly.Overall the image quality is top-notch. The entire scope of delivery really leaves nothing to be desired. A first start into the world of self-optimization in road traffic is very easy and straightforward with the Vantrue E2 set. What I would be interested in myself is how the installation works in a car from the last 2 years.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519UCnheG+L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61B5HKOuh5L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FphTd+70L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JR6o-IjJL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RjsI7M7rL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61oKgqaUVzL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714vUp-05HL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BnxKoxykL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71J9R3IMUjL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71hd8BkOkyL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RXB5UQF9CF2W/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

Tip - Load the app and use a phone live view while setting up as you can easily see what the view will be from the back of your vehicle while mounting.)All you need to be fully up, and running is a micro sd card which is cheap these days thankfully. I was able to get this installed in less than 30 minutes which included running a cable down the side of my car to the rear hatch.In terms of features, this had everything I was looking for.-Front and rear cameras with a solid feel to the unit. (Nothing flimsy and the cables provided are nice quality.)-Remote control. You can mute the camera and take photos from the remote. Remote does not need to be hard-wired.-Voice-activated. You can simply say take a photo and voila, you have a photo. This is super nifty when you want a photo or something to be done and do not want to be distracted by a remote or camera buttons. (I did notice there are no commands listed in the manual. You can view a list of these in the camera settings.) And yes, you can turn on and off the ""take photo"" noise pending your taste.-Has built-in GPS, shows MPH, and offers dual 2.5K resolution recording. (This means a lot if you ever need to pull footage and actually have the ability to read license plates, etc.)Another cool feature to me is the Wifi ability as none of my other cameras had this. This allows you to view-download from your camera wirelessly using the free app. Before I had to remove the micro sd card and put it on a pc to view and work with. This saves me a lot of time. The app is very well laid out and makes finding the video you are looking for super easy. The wifi-app feature is also incredibly easy to use and helpful when going through the settings on your camera. Instead of pushing the buttons on the unit, you can just go into the app and change whatever settings you need quickly and from your phone.The video has proven to be sharp, and I like the fact they use Sony Starvis sensors vs. a cheaper one. The viewing angle is also greater than many of the other cameras which let you have a wider viewing angle at 160degrees. It should also be noted that the F1.8 on the sensor was appealing and does very well in low light without getting grainy. (If you used dash cams before at night, you will know how much this can be an issue.)I hope to never actually “need” this, but it is a peace of mind deal, and hoping this will remain strong for years to come. The only investment I plan on making is going for the 512GB micro sd card vs. the 64GB card I am using.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71aM1WIVybL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cx8W3+pPL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eiIYTFTOL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWDD0LD2LY7UP/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","B0B6B6RQT1","Size: E2"

Here in FL it gets really warm and the suction cup tends to fall off quite a bit. So I would get into my car and the dash cam would be swaying from its power cord, so frustrating. Vantrue shipped me a free adhesive mount and so far it seems to be doing the trick. I really appreciate good customer service when I see it, thanks guys!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM9MLA65VW7SQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0B6B6RQT1","-","-"
